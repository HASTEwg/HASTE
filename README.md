# HASTE

The High-Altitude to Space Transport Estimator (HASTE) estimator is a high fidelity Monte Carlo code written in modern Fortran for estimating the radiation field seen by a space-based detector from a point source in or above the atmosphere.  The HASTE code includes models for many of the special features of this air-to-space transport problem that are not modeled, or only partially modeled, in other transport codes.  Special features of the air-to-space transport problem include:
- Continuous treatment of the atmospheric density function
- Relative motions of source, detector, scattering medium (Earth rotation, atmospheric motion, thermal vibration of scattering nuclei)
- Gravity
- Radioactive decay of free neutrons

This code was originally developed in support of dissertation research at the Air Force Institute of Technology, and now remains under collaborative development in the radiation effects and detection community.  Roadmap for feature development is [in the wiki](https://github.com/HASTEwg/HASTE/wiki/Roadmap-&-Testing).

Currently, the source is LIMITED BETA (v0.10.xx):  The version on branch [Extra--Lamere](https://github.com/HASTEwg/HASTE/tree/Extra--Lamere) is functional (with the example setup file and resource files on that branch), but all features are NOT verified and debugged.  The next full working increment will be v1.0-beta followed by release of v1.0: date TBD.  I'm working at a commensurate speed to how much you're paying me.  Increment to v1.0 is contingent on completing the remaining tasks laid out in the development roadmap.
