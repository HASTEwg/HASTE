# HATS

The High-Altitude Transport to Space (HATS) estimator is a high fidelity Monte Carlo code written in modern Fortran for estimating the radiation field seen by a space-based detector from a point source in or above the atmosphere.  This code was originally developed in support of dissertation research at the Air Force Institute of Technology, and now remains under collaborative development in the radiation effects and detection community.
